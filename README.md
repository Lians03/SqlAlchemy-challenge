# Honolulu, Hawaii Climate Analysis
This project involves conducting a detailed climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask. The analysis is split into two main parts: exploring and analyzing climate data, and designing a Flask API based on the findings.

First, I analyze climate data, focusing on precipitation and temperature trends, using SQLAlchemy for database queries and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization. Then, I develop a Flask API, providing endpoints to access climate data, including precipitation, station information, and temperature observations. This API serves as an interface to interact with the analyzed data, allowing users to query specific date ranges and retrieve summarized climate information in a user-friendly JSON format.
